                <p>A web development and databases module taught me to programme in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.</p>
                <p>The Human Interaction module was particularly interesting because it explained the theory behind successful designing.</p>
                <p>I have competent skills in Java (I achieved 81% in an Object Orientated Programming module).</p>
                <p>People & Computing and Human Computer Interaction modules comprised of two separate team projects, from design to the Lo-Fi prototype.
                </p>
                <p>These enabled me to liaise and collaborate with other team members. The modules taught the principles of successful designing, focussing on user-centred approach techniques such as the Heuristics Evaluation.e</p>
